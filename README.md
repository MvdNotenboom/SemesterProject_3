# SemesterProject_3
Third semester project Software Engineering, Heterogenous system

This project works to provide a time logging system for the (fictional) Happy Pig Company. The goal
is to create a software system that will be more efficient, easy to use and maintain, and
less prone to errors.
To achieve this, as well as provide possibilities for future scalability and expandability, the
system must be distributed and having a three-tier architecture. In addition, the system should
be connected to a relational database and have a user interface.
The system should be accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, to satisfy
that the user interface is a C# web application. The logic tier is designed as an Application
Programming Interface that allows communication through HTTP Requests, as well as the
possibility for future expansion of the client tier. The data tier uses Entity Framework
technology that allows an easier design of the database through object-mapping.
Because the system is exposed to the internet, certain security policies were defined and
the mechanisms to enforce them were put in place to ensure a degree of safety for the
system.
The result of this project is a software system that has the basic architecture for a working
product. Unfortunately, the system does not yet satisfy all the requirements in order to be
usable in the company on a daily basis

The project was made during the third semester at the VIA university college during an Software engineering Bachelor. It was made by a group with 3 members.
